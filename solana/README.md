# Solana Auditing

This repository documents the steps and tutorials I have undertaken, or am currently engaged in, to become great at auditing Solana programs (smart contracts).

## Getting Started with Solana Development

I like the "learn by doing" method, so here are the resources that got me into Solana and Anchor:

* [Solana Introduction](https://github.com/Emskiq/solana-intro) - A personal repository containing simple Solana programs and smart contracts.

* [Ackee School of Solana](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/school-of-solana) - An excellent introduction to Solana.

* [NFT Marketplace](https://github.com/Emskiq/nft-marketplace-solana) - A personal project for an NFT Marketplace platform, including frontend integration and deployed programs on Solana devnet. I highly recommend conceiving your own project idea and bringing it to fruition.


## Solana Security Resources

**I (again) emphasize a practical approach: dive into audits or participate in past audit contests to enhance your skills.**

However here is a *not so old* and valuable resources to get you into the security aspects of Solana:

* [Ackee Solana Auditor Bootcamp](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/Solana-Auditors-Bootcamp/tree/master) - An introduction to Solana security.

* [A Hitchhiker's Guide to Solana Program Security](https://www.helius.dev/blog/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-solana-program-security) - A well-structured blog post detailing common Solana/Anchor vulnerabilities.

* [Awesome Solana Security](https://github.com/az0mb13/awesome-solana-security) - A curated list of Solana security resources, including audit techniques, tools, and real-life exploits.

* [SolSec](https://github.com/sannykim/solsec) - A collection of resources focused on Solana smart contract security, auditing, and exploits.

* [Solana Security Workshop](https://workshop.neodyme.io/) - A workshop that examines Solana smart contracts from an attacker's perspective, aiding in writing more secure contracts.

## Audits

- **[Sociogram](https://sociogram.org/)**
    - [Personal audit](audits/sociogram-my-audit.md) - 1 Critical, 2 Mid, 2 Low
    - [Hacken's audit](audits/sociogram-hacken-audit.pdf)

- **[Pump Science](https://pumpscience.gitbook.io/pump.science)**
    - [Personal audit](audits/pump-science-my-report.md) - 2 Low + couple of Informationals
    - [Pashov Group's audit](audits/pump-science-Pashov-group-audit.pdf)
